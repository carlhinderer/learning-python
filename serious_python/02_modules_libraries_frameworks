CHAPTER 2 - MODULES, LIBRARIES, & FRAMEWORKS
--------------------------------------------------------------------

- The Import System

    - The 'import' keyword is actually a wrapper around a function named '__import__'.

        # These are the same
        >>> import itertools
        >>> itertools = __import__("itertools")

        # These are also the same
        >>> import itertools as it
        >>> it = __import__("itertools")


    - This technique can be leveraged to load a module whose name you don't know at compile time.  
        Remember that modules, once imported, are essentially objects with classes, functions, 
        variables, etc.

        >>> random = __import__("RANDOM".lower())



- The sys Module

    - The 'sys' module provides access to variables and functions related to Python itself and the 
        operating system it is running on.  It also contains information about Python's import
        system.


    - The 'sys.modules' variable is a dictionary whose key is the module name and value is the 
        module object.

        >>> import sys
        >>> import os
        >>> sys.modules['os']
        <module 'os' from '/usr/lib/python2.7/os.pyc'>


    - We can also retrieve the list of built-in modules.

        >>> import sys
        >>> sys.builtin_module_names



- Import Paths

    - When importing modules, Python relies on a list of paths to know where to look for the
        module.  This list is stored in the 'sys.path' variable.

        # Add a path for modules
        >>> import sys
        >>> sys.path.append('/foo/bar')



- Custom Importers

    - The import mechanism can be extended using custom importers.  This 'import hook technique'
        is defined by PEP 302.

      For example, you could write an extension that imports modules from a database or does
        sanity checks before importing a module.


    - Python offers 2 different ways to broaden the import system:

        1. Meta Path Finders for use with 'sys.meta_path'
        2. Path Entry Finders for use with 'sys.path_hooks'



- Meta Path Finders

    - The 'meta path finder' is an object that will allow you to load custom objects as well as
        standard .py files.  

      A meta path finder object must expose a 'find_module(fullname, path=None)' method that returns 
        a loader object.  The loader object must also have a 'load_module(fullname)' method
        resposible for loading the module from a source file.


    - We want to write classes so that we can load modules in files with .hy extensions.  Here is the
        finder object:

        class MetaImporter(object):
            def find_on_path(self, fullname):
                fls = ["%s/__init__.hy", "%s.hy"]
                dirpath = "/".join(fullname.split("."))
        
                for pth in sys.path:
                    pth = os.path.abspath(pth)
                    for fp in fls:
                        composed_path = fp % ("%s/%s" % (pth, dirpath))
                        if os.path.exists(composed_path):
                            return composed_path
        
            def find_module(self, fullname, path=None):
                path = self.find_on_path(fullname)
                if path:
                    return MetaLoader(path)

        sys.meta_path.append(MetaImporter())


    - Once Python has determined that the path is valid and points to a module, a 'MetaLoader' class is
        returned:

        class MetaLoader(object):
            def __init__(self, path):
                self.path = path
        
            def is_package(self, fullname):
                dirpath = "/".join(fullname.split("."))
                for pth in sys.path:
                    pth = os.path.abspath(pth)
                    composed_path = "%s/%s/__init__.hy" % (pth, dirpath)
                    if os.path.exists(composed_path):
                        return True
                return False
        
            def load_module(self, fullname):
                if fullname in sys.modules:
                    return sys.modules[fullname]
        
                if not self.path:
                    return
        
                sys.modules[fullname] = None
                mod = import_file_to_module(fullname, self.path)
        
                ispkg = self.is_package(fullname)
        
                mod.__file__ = self.path
                mod.__loader__ = self
                mod.__name__ = fullname
        
                if ispkg:
                    mod.__path__ = []
                    mod.__package__ = fullname
                else:
                    mod.__package__ = fullname.rpartition('.')[0]
        
                sys.modules[fullname] = mod
                return mod
