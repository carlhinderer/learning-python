CHAPTER 2 - HOW PYTHON RUNS PROGRAMS
-------------------------------------------------

1. Source code files are translated into platform-independent byte code.  

2. Byte Code is cached in .pyc files

     - Before Python 3.2, these files were put into the same directory as your
         source code.

     - In Python 3.2+, these .pyc files are saved in a subdirectory called 
         '__pycache__'

     - Python detects changes in source files by looking at the LastModified 
         timestamps of the source and byte code files.

     - Python checks whether a files needs to be recompiled because it was created
         by a different Python version, either using a magic number in the byte
         code (<3.2) or looking at the filename (3.2+)

         script.py
         __pycache__/script.cpython-33.pyc

     - If Python does not have write privileges to the machine, byte code will
         never be cached.  It never gets cached in the interactive prompt either.


3. Byte Code is executed by the Python Virtual Machine

     - The PVM is the runtime engine of Python.  It's the last step of what is 
          called the 'Python interpreter'.



- Performance Implications

    - Byte code is not machine code.  The PVM loop, not the CPU chip, must still 
        interpret the byte code.  This is why Python code does not run as fast as C/C++ code.  


- Common Python Implementations

    1. CPython = the standard implementation, written in ANSI C

    2. Jython = written in Java

    3. IronPython = written for .NET

    4. Stackless = does not save state on C call stack, allowing for microthreads
                   and coroutines

    5. PyPy = C implementation with a Jitter, successor to the original Pysco JIT

              The JIT is an extension to the PVM that translates portions of your 
                byte code all the way down to binary machine code for faster
                execution.

              PyPy can speed up the execution of some code by 10x-100x
