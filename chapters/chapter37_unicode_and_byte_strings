CHAPTER 37 - UNICODE AND BYTE STRINGS
-------------------------------------------------

- Character sets assign integer codes to individual characters.

    - ASCII 
        - defines character codes 0-127, so that each character can be stored in 7 bits
        - fixed-size characters
        - created in the USA
        - many standards use values 128-255 to accomodate special characters

      # Use the built-in 'ord' function to get a character's ASCII code
      >>> ord('a')
      97
      >>> chr(97)
      'a'


    - Latin-1
        - used widely in Western Europe
        - fixed-size characters
        - supports ASCII standard
        - values 128-255 are used for accented and other special characters


    - Unicode
        - characters may be represented in multiple bytes if needed (variable-sized characters)
        - typically used in internationalized applications



- Encoding and Decoding

    - Encoding = translate string of characters into it's raw byte form
    - Decoding = translate raw string of bytes into character string form



- UTF-8 Encoding

    - Widely used
    - ASCII is a subset of both UTF-8 and Latin-1 (ie. any ASCII file is a valid UTF-8 file)

    - Codes 0-127 are represented as a single byte
    - Codes 128-2047 are turned into 2 bytes
    - Codes above 2047 are turned into 3- or 4-byte sequences



- UTF-16 and UTF-32

    - UTF-16 uses a fixed-size 2-byte character scheme
    - UTF-32 uses a fixed-size 4-byte character scheme



- The string 'encode' Method

    >>> S = 'ni'
    >>> S.encode('ascii'), S.encode('latin1'), S.encode('utf8')
    (b'ni', b'ni', b'ni')

    >>> S.encode('utf16'), len(S.encode('utf16'))
    (b'\xff\xfen\x00i\x00', 6)

    >>> S.encode('utf32'), len(S.encode('utf32'))
    (b'\xff\xfe\x00\x00n\x00\x00\x00i\x00\x00\x00', 12)



- How Python Stores Strings in Memory

    Encodings only really apply when text is stored or transferred externally.  In memory,
      Python always stores decoded text in an encoding-neutral format.  All text processing
      occurs in this uniform internal format.

    Text is translated to and from an encoding-specific format only when it is transferred to
      or from exernal text files, byte strings, or APIs.


    - In <=3.2, Python stored strings internally as fixed-length UTF-16 (2 bytes per char)
    - In 3.3+, a variable-length scheme with 1, 2, or 4 bytes per character is used



- Python String Types

    - Python 2.X has 2 string types:
        - 'str' for 8-bit text and binary data
        - 'unicode' for unicode text

    - Python 3.X has 3 string types:
        - 'str' for representing decoded Unicode text (including ASCII)
        - 'bytes' for representing binary data
        - 'bytearray', a mutable version of 'bytes'



- 'bytes' and 'bytearray'

    - 'bytes' is similar to the 'str', it is an immutable sequence used to represent binary
        data, and supports most string methods.  Internally, it is implemented as a sequence of 
        small integers (0-255).  Indexing a 'bytes' returns an int, slicing one returns another 
        'bytes', and running the list built-in on one returns a list of integers, not characters.

    - 'bytearray' is a variant of 'bytes' that is mutable.



- Text and Binary Files

    - When a file is opened in 'text mode', reading its data automatically decodes its content
        and returns it as a 'str'.  Writing to a file takes a 'str' and automatically
        encodes it before transferring it to a file.  The encoding used by default is set at
        the platform level.  

      Text-mode files also handle the BOM (Byte Order Marker) sequence that may appear at the 
        beginning of files under some encoding schemes.  For instance, the BOM specifies whether
        big-endian or little-endian format is to be used for UTF-16 and UTF-32.

    - When a file is opened in 'binary mode' by adding a 'b' to the mode argument, reading 
        its data doesn't do any decoding.  The file contents are returned raw and unchanged.
        Writing takes a 'bytes' object and transfers it to the file unchanged.  This will most 
        likely be used to process images, data transferred over networks, packed binary data
        that must be extracted, or device data streams.



- To see all the encodings supported by Python,

    >>> import encodings
    >>> help(encodings)



- Python 3.X String Literals

    >>> B = b'spam'
    >>> B
    b'spam'

    >>> type(B)
    <class 'bytes'>

    >>> B[0]
    115

    >>> B[1:]
    b'pam'

    >>> list(B)
    [115, 112, 97, 109]



- String Type Conversions

    # Encode text into raw bytes
    >>> S = 'eggs'
    >>> S.encode()
    b'eggs'
    >>> bytes(S, encoding='ascii')
    b'eggs'

    # Decode raw bytes into text
    >>> B = b'spam'
    >>> B.decode()
    'spam'
    >>> str(B, encoding='ascii')
    'spam'



- Coding Non-ASCII Characters

    >>> chr(0xc4)         # 0xC4, 0xE8: characters outside ASCII's range
    'Ä'
    >>> chr(0xe8)
    'è'

    >>> S = '\xc4\xe8'    # Single 8-bit value hex escapes: two digits
    >>> S
    'Äè'

    >>> S = '\u00c4\u00e8'   # 16-bit Unicode escapes: four digits each
    >>> S
    'Äè'

    >>> len(S)            # Two characters long (not number of bytes!)
    2

    >>> S = '\U000000c4\U000000e8'       # 32-bit Unicode escapes: eight digits each
    >>> S
    'Äè'

    >>> S.encode('ascii')
    UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode characters in position 0-1: ordinal 
    not in range(128)



- Either hex escapes or Unicode escapes can be embedded into 3.X strings.  Only hex escapes
    are allowed in 'bytes' literals.



- The 'bytes' Type

    - 'bytes' supports most string operations (excluding 'format' and %)
    - 'bytes' and 'str' types cannot be mixed without explicit conversions


    >>> B = b'spam'     # b'...' bytes literal

    >>> B.find(b'pa')
    1

    >>> B.replace(b'pa', b'XY')     # bytes methods expect bytes arguments
    b'sXYm'

    >>> B.split(b'pa')     # bytes methods return bytes results
    [b's', b'm']



- The 'bytearray' Type

    # Create bytearray from string, must specify encoding
    >>> S = 'spam'
    >>> C = bytearray(S, 'latin1')
    >>> C
    bytearray(b'spam')

    # Create bytearray from bytes
    >>> B = b'spam'
    >>> C = bytearray(B)
    >>> C
    bytearray(b'spam')

    >>> C[0] = ord('x')
    >>> C
    bytearrary(b'xpam')

    >>> C[1] = b'Y'[0]
    >>> C
    bytearray(b'xYam')

    >>> C.append(ord('L'))
    >>> C
    bytearray(b'xYamL')

    >>> C.extend(b'MNO')
    >>> C
    bytearray(b'xYamLMNO')

    >>> C.replace(b'xY', b'sp')
    >>> C
    bytearray(b'spamLMNO')



- Reading and Writing Binary Files

    # Write to binary file
    >>> open('temp', 'wb').write(b'abc\n')
    4

    # Read binary file
    >>> open('temp', 'r').read()
    'abc\m'

    # Read binary file and return bytes
    >>> open('temp', 'rb').read()
    b'abc\n'



- Specifying Encoding for File Reading/Writing

    >>> S = 'A\xc4B\xe8C'      # Five-character decoded string, non-ASCII
    >>> S
    'AÄBèC'

    # Encoding automatically when written
    >>> open('latindata', 'w', encoding='latin-1').write(S)     # Write as latin-1
    5

    >>> open('utf8data', 'w', encoding='utf-8').write(S)        # Write as utf-8
    5

    >>> open('latindata', 'rb').read()                          # Read raw bytes
    b'A\xc4B\xe8C'

    >>> open('utf8data', 'rb').read()                           # Different in files
    b'A\xc3\x84B\xc3\xa8C'
